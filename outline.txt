Productivity / day
------------------
- completing set goals
	* how many goals were you able to remove from the queue
	* how many goals could you have removed from the queue
- resisting unproductive temptations
  - hours spent on:
	- tiktok
	- clash royale
	- chrome
- conforming to schedule by specified hours -- earlier contributes positively, later contributes negatively
	- wake up by 9
	- sleep by 1
	- lunch by 1:30
	- dinner by 7

Needed functionality
--------------------
GOAL object
- notion of GOAL: 
	- priority level
	- approximate time commitment
	- due date (must support none)

// TODO
- scheduling goals for the future
- convert from human readable due date to long // DONE
- standard priority values (look into enums) // DONE
- update goal (i.e. progress signal) // DONE
- "Banner" goals -- goals that need to be pinned without expiry
	- closing banner goals

- easily craete and store new goals through IO processes
- easily log goal completion

- propose best set of goals to attempt any given day

Fill free time with queue items:
- queue sorted by priority, then due date


- automatically log unproductive hours from screen time
- provide ease of logging time for wake up, sleep, lunch, dinner

- generate report on day-to-day growth
